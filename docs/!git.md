## Commonly used git commands

### First time set up

Configure user name and email. Every commit object holds this information, so you can't make a commit without it.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

---

Configure aliases to save time when typing commands:

```bash
$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status
$ git config --global alias.l 'log --all --decorate --oneline --graph'
$ git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
```

You can find global user configuration settings in `$HOME/.giconfig`

### Make a commit

**Stage** (also know as **index**) acts as a buffer for changes that will go into the next commit. You need to add changes to `stage` before you can commit those changes.

`git add .` - stage all changes in the current directories and all subdirectories.
`git add file.txt` - stage a specific file.

---

`git commit -m "#2443 fix broken assets"`  - commit staged changes with a message
`git commit -am "#2443 fix broken assets"` - automatically stage changed files (this doesn't include newly created files, only the files changed since last commit) and make a commit.

### Unstage

`git reset` - unstage all staged changes.

---

`git reset HEAD -- file.txt` - unstage a specific file.
`git unstage file.txt` - the same command, but using the alias created in the setup section.

### Change the last commit

1. make changes in the working directory that you want to include in the last commit.
2. stage made changes using `git add` command
3. use `git commit --amend -m "some commit message"` to change the last commit.

Note: changing the last commit with `git commit --amend` creates a new commit object with a new hash, which means this command changes commit history. You only want to use this command for fixing unpublished commits, i.e. those commits that you haven't yet pushed to a remote repository and shared with others.

---

If you only want to change message of the last commit:

```bash
$ git commit --amend -m "some commit message"
```

---

If you want to make changes to the last commit, but don't want to change its message:

```bash
$ git add file.txt # stage changes you want to add to the last commit
$ git commit --amend --no-edit # don't edit the message
```

### Create a local branch

`git branch new-feature` - creat a local branch off the current commit. To switch to that branch use `git checkout new-feature`.
`git checkout -b new-feature` - create a local branch named `new-feature` off the current commit and switch to that branch.

### Create a remote branch

```bash
$ git checkout -b new-feature # create a local branch and switch to it
$ git push -u origin new-feature # create a remote branch and tell the local to track it
```
`-u` - tells git that the local `new-feature` (on which you're now) should be _tracking_ branch `new-feature` in remote repository. Tracking means that syncronization commands like `git fetch`, `git push`, `git pull` will work without you having to specify exlicitly to which branch you want to push/download commits.

`origin` is a shortname for a remote repository. Git matches a URL of a remote repository with a shortname, which makes it easy to specify a remote repository without having to remember the whole URL. `origin` is the default name that is given to a remote repository when you do `git clone`. So if you `cloned` your repository, you can simply refer to remote repository by its shortname `origin` in all other commands.

### List branches

`git branch` - list local branches.
`git branch -r` - list remote branches. Remote branches will most likely have prefix `origin/` which indicates the remote repository where the branch exists. Local branches won't have this prefix.
`git branch -a` - list local and remote branches.

### Checkout a remote branch

When you do `git clone` only the master branch is checked out by default. If you want to download other remote branches you'll need to use the following command:

`git brach -r` - find a remote branch you want to checkout
`git checkout new-feature` - checkout a remote branch (note: you don't have to use `origin` prefix).

### Show commit history

`git log` - show commits of the current branch
`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` - show commit history of all branches and show the graph of commits. (use alias `git l` from above)

### Undoing commits

Use `git reset` for unpublished commits (i.e., local commits that are not shared with others) as it changes the commit history.

`git reset --hard <commit>` - reset the HEAD (pointer to the current commit) to a specified commit on the branch. Any changes to tracked files in the working directory since `<commit>` are discarded.
`git reset --soft <commit>` - reset the HEAD to a specified commit on the branch. Changed files after `<commit>` won't be removed and will be placed in staging.
`git reset <commit>` - reset the HEAD to a specified commit on the branch. Changed files after `<commit>` won't be removed and but won't be staged as in case of `--soft`.

[Explanation of the difference between --soft, --hard, --mixed options with example](https://gist.github.com/tnguyen14/0827ae6eefdff39e452b)

---

For published commits (pushed to the remote repo), use `git revert`. This will create a new commit, that reverts the changes of the commit you specify.

`git revert <commit>` - revert a commit.
`git revert <commit> <file>` - This turns the <file> that resides in the working directory into an exact copy of the one from <commit> and adds it to the staging area. You can then re-commit the old version as you would any other file. This basically serves as a way to revert back to an old version of an individual file.

### Checkout a commit

If you want to view a state of you files at particular commit, use `git checkout <commit>` to move you HEAD to that commit. The content of your repo will be changed to reflect the state of this particular commit. After youâ€™re finished viewing the old version of your repository, you can move the HEAD back to the tip of your branch and load the current state of your repository:
```
git checkout master
```

### Commit reference

You can always reference a commit by hash, which you can get from `git log` output.

HEAD - current commit.
HEAD~1 - first parent of the current commit.
master~1 - first parent of the commit to which `master` is pointing right now.

### Commit search

[Examples](http://artemstar.com/2017/03/26/git/).

`git log -S "Hello, World!" --oneline` - search by the commit content. Use it when you want to find a commit when a specific line of code was introduced or deleted.
---

`git log --grep="#2244" --oneline` - search by commit message.


### Diff

`git diff <commit>` - show changes in the working directory not staged for commit relative to the specified commit. If no commit is given, it defaults to the latest commit (HEAD). Thus, `git diff` will show unstaged changes in the working directory relative to the last commit.
`git diff --staged <commit>` - show changes staged for commit.
`git diff <commit> -- ./file.txt` - show changes of a specific file not staged for commit. Instead of path to a file, you can also specify path to a directory after `--`.
`git diff <commit1> <commit2>` - show changes between two commits.
